# Steps to Run
1. change the input.json file with the input you want to test the code with
2. Run UnitTest.py
3. you should be able to see the output in the console with the format: "Store with location xyz has been visited n times"

# Objective:

Write a method that accepts a list of stores (represented as rough x and y location coordinates) that have been visited along a truck delivery route.  We need to determine how many times each store is visited for deliveries.  The method should return each unique store (set of coordinates), along with how many times that set of coordinates occurred in the list.  That result should also be displayed.

Test values:
[{“x”:5, “y”:3},

{“x”:0, “y”:0},

{“x”:4, “y”:3},

{“x”:3, “y”:3},

{“x”:2, “y”:3},

{“x”:1, “y”:3},

{“x”:0, “y”:3},

{“x”:-1, “y”:3},

{“x”:5, “y”:3},

{“x”:0, “y”:0},

{“x”:5, “y”:3}]
